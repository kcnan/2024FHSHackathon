2024 FHS Hackathon App Archive
==========================
- Programmed by Kasey N.
- Designed by Adrian, Polly and Camilla.

This application is called PlanIt, and was made (within 3 hours) to let you
know if your eating habits (fat, protein, and carb intakes, as well as times
you eat) are good or bad, and tells you what to strive for.

The app framework was Java's Swing library, which was desperately learned
overnight before the hackathon.

> this is a silly app that likely will not give you any reliable
information whatsoever and is purely a proof-of-concept for the hackathon
